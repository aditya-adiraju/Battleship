# CPSC 210 Personal Project: Battleship

### What will this application do?

This application enables users to play a multiplayer version of the classic game of Battleship. Battleship is a fun and
strategic guessing game where players place their ships on their 10x10 playing board and exchange turns guessing where their opponents placed their ships. The game ends when all the ships of an opponent are sunk. (The player with the sunk battleships loses)

### Who will use it?
The intended audience for this application includes everyone. Specifically, groups of 2 players who wish to play a
nostalgic guessing game or simply wish to use this as a means to resolve an argument.

### Why am I making this project?
Battleship has always been a staple boardgame in my household. When I came to university, I discovered that many of my
friends have never heard of it before. This was quite shocking to me since to me the game is a symbol of family game
nights. Hence, I want to make this project to make this beloved game more accessible to everyone.


## User-Stories


As a user, I want to be able to:
- name my player and opponent
- add ships to my board
- choose coordinates to strike on my opponent's board for my missiles
- save a tally of my wins against others
- pause and resume the game at a later point in time (Battleship is a long game that can take over 30 minutes)
